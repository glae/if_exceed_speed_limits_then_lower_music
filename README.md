# If exceed speed limits then lower music volume

## Goal

This is an Android prototype application aiming to encourage a driver to respect speed limits, by reducing music volume when exceeding speed limit. It uses GPS and data connection.

A related app is [Speed of sound](https://github.com/jpeddicord/speedofsound), without speed limits awareness.


## Install instructions

The application requires at least Android Kitkat (4.4, API 19). 

1. The app is not on the Play Store, so first you'll need to authorize unknown sources
2. Download and execute on the phone the [Android package (APK)](https://github.com/glae/exceed_speed_limits_then_lower_music/releases)

**Warning**: the app is very volume-related intrusive (foreground and background), you'll need to kill it to restore normal music volume use.
